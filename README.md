## Introduction

This is a repo for leetcode notes based on cpp.

Actually the notes cover about 150 common problems in leetcode and some of my clumsy analysis mainly in Chinese.

This is only for back-up, for some reason, there will be no following updates. 

## Reference

Carl is really a good teacher for explaining those basic leetcode problems. When I knew little about code and algorithms, it was he who guides me to the real leetcode world.
